title: About

Iâ€™m keeping this blog mainly as a way to document different solutions that I come up with on my daily job. Itâ€™s in no way comprehensive or fault-free (use at your own risk ðŸ˜…).

My main experience has been working as a Linux System Administrator. Recently, I've shifted focus towards a DevOps/SRE role.

Also, I'm a really big fan of automation.
